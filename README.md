# packpoly

## Problem
This work addresses a problem related to the packing of identical regular
polyhedra in arbitrary Euclidean space. The problem aims to maximize the number of
identical regular polyhedra that can be packed within a convex set, referred to as the
domain. The problem is modeled as a nonlinear differentiable programming problem.
